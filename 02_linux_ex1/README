Kernel System Calls
-------------------
You begin by downloading a file from the web using the wget command, afterwards you make it executable with the chmod
command for myself (and removing read permissions from group and others). The whatIdo executable opens a directory
under the name of welcomeToDevOpsMay22 and creates a file in it called goodLuck. That exe also writes
There you go... tell me what I do into the goodLuck file.

Binary Numbers
--------------
1. 111 = 7, 100 = 4, 10110 = 22
2. 2^8 = 256
3. Left most bit will be used as a sign 0 for positive, 1 for negative. The other 8 bits will be used to represent
values 0-255.
4. Floating numbers can be represented in a 8 bit system but that is extremely limited, as many numbers cannot be
represented accurately. We can use the left most bit for sign (-/+), the following 3 bits as our integer portion and
the other 4 at the decimal portion. You calculate the integer by repetitive division by 2and the decimal by repetitive
multiplication by 2. Then you add the integers bottom-top and decimals top-bottom.
For example:
3.25
Integer:
3/2=1.5 (1)
1/2=0.5 (1) *stop at 0*
Decimal:
0.25*2=0.5 (0)
0.5*2=1 (1) *stop at 1*
The result is 11.01. After shifting the decimal point by 2^1 we get the scientific value of 1.1010. We add the bias of 3
to the exponent and get 4 which is represented by 100. Adding the sign gives us the 8 bit combination the binary
represents 01001010.
Different example:
15.25
Integer:
15/2=7.5 (1)
7/2=3.5 (1)
3/2=1.5 (1)
1/2=0.5 (1) *stop at 1*
Decimal:
0.25*2=0.5 (0)
0.5*2=1 (1) *stop at 1*
The result is 1111.01. The scientific notation to extract the mantissa of the float is 11101 (1.11101*2^3) which is 5
bits long; too big for the allotted 4 bits in a bias of 3. In short, it can't be represented in 8 bit system.
Because there are only 8 bits, there is only so much that can be done. More bits are needed to
represent a number even such as 16, which our 3 bit integer can't do (with 15 being the max number).
Most systems use IEEE 754 standard the utilizes 32 bits.
