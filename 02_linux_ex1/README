The command refers to a specific file found on Amazon's website. The reference is made using the WGET command.
It is not possible to see which ones are taking place, so I will use the command "STRACE -o (name of folder)"
vi ./(name of folder).
Can see the size of the file, the time it was created, the download speed

The command wget Allows files to be downloaded from the server.
The command strace allows you to view the text of certain files and identify bugs.

Binary Numbers
--------------
1) 111=7 , 100=4, 10110=22
2)The decimal range represented by an 8-bit binary number is 256.
3)We will use the 8 bits to represent the number.
 The 9th bit will be a minus sign, negative binary numbers are represented using a minus sign.
 4) The first bit will determine what sign will the number get, if the first bit is "0" the number will be positive ,
if the bit is "1" the number will be negative.
We will convert the next three bits to a decimal number (X) and perform the following calculation: 3-X=Y, raise the digit 2 to the power of the number we got (Y).
The following four numbers are calculated as follows:
X* 2^0+X*2^-1+X*2^-2+X*2^-3
At the end the result of the calculation is the final decimal number .
