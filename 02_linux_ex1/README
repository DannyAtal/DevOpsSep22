Kernel System Calls
-------------------
After performing the asked commands and following the strace of the
program I understand that the file in the c code "whatIdo.c" is
printing the content of "welcomeToDevOpsJan22/goodLuck"
then the file closes with 0 errors.


Binary Numbers
--------------
1. 111 = 7, 100 = 4, 10110 = 22

2. 0 through 255

3. With sign magnitude method we designate one of the bits (usually the far left,
   also known as the most significant bit) to indicate whether a number is
   positive or negative. Usually a '0' indicates the number is positive and a '1'
   indicates the number is negative. Example of using this method :

                    100000101 = -5
                    000000101 = 5

4. eight bit floating-point format can represent positive numbers from about 0.0078(10)
   to 480(10). In contrast, the eight bit two's-complement representation can only represent
   positive numbers between 1 and 127, But the floating-point representation can't represent
   all of the numbers in its range this would be impossible, since eight bits can represent
   only 2^8  = 256 distinct values, and there are infinitely many real numbers in the range
   to represent.
