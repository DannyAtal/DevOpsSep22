Kernel System Calls
-------------------
After downloading the file using the wget command, we turn it into an executable with the chmod command. The whatIdo file
creates a directory called "welcomeToDevOpsMay22". Inside the directory is a txt file named "goodLuck". Using the cat
command we say that it says "There you go... tell me what I do..."
Essentially the executable creates a directory containing a txt file.

Binary Numbers
--------------
1) 7, 4, 22
2) 0 through 255
3) In order to represent a negative 8 bit binary number, we can use the 9th bit to declare whether the number is positive or negative (0 = positive, 1 = negative)
4) All floating-point numbers consist of three parts:
    1) A sign which indicates whether the number is positive or negative
    2) An exponent that is either positive or negative
    3) A mantissa, which is the fractional portion of the number after it has been normalized in scientific notation
        In an 8-bit format, one bit is reserved for the sign as always, three bits are used for the biased exponent, and the remaining four bits are used for the mantissa.
    To convert fraction to binary, start with the fraction in question and multiply it by 2 keeping notice of the resulting integer and fractional part.
    Continue multiplying by 2 until you get a resulting fractional part equal to zero. Then just write out the integer parts from the results of each multiplication.
