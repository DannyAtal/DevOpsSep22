The command refers to a specific file found on Amazon's website. The reference is made using the WGET command.
It is not possible to see which ones are taking place, so I will use the command "STRACE -o (name of folder)"
vi ./(name of folder).


The command wget Allows files to be downloaded from the server.
The command strace allows you to view the text of certain files and identify bugs.
