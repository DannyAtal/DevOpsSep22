Kernel System Calls
-------------------
    We downloaded a file called "whatIdo" from the web using the
    wget command. We gave the user full permissions to that file,
    and we didn't give any permissions to the group and the readers.

    The trace program shows us what our command is doing in terms of system calls.
    The “strace” command tool prints how the program operates and communicates with the system.
    Through this, the user can easily decipher where the errors are occurring while loading the program.


Binary Numbers
--------------
1.  111=7
    100=4
    10110=22

2.  (11111111)=255 the range: 0-255 -->256

3.  The leftmost bit (MSB) is the sign bit 0= +  1= -
    And the rest of the bits are the number

  Another method

    Two's complement

    a.We will write the number in positive form.
    b.We will add another bit on the left side.
     0:(+) , 1:(-)
    c.we will reverse the bits.
    d.Add 1 to the number.

    5=101 -> 0101 ->(not) 1010 +1 ->     1011 = -5

4.  We will take the floating point and multiply it by 2.
    We will refer to the number on the left side of the point and write it down on the side.
    Multiply by 2 again after subtracting the whole (because we have already used it)
    As we continue to multiply, the level of accuracy will increase

    for example
    2.7:
    0.7*2=1.4->1
    0.4*2=0.8->0
    0.8*2=1.6->1
    0.6*2=1.2->1

      2 . 7
    0010.1011
