Kernel System Calls
-------------------

So the program is very simple, first we download a file which called whatIdo using wget command,
then we simply change the mode of the file to executable so it becomes usable.
then we execute the file whatIdo

# stat("./welcomeToDevOpsMay22", {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0700, st_size=4096, ...}) = 0

first it does a stat command on ./welcomeToDevOpsMay22

# openat(AT_FDCWD, "welcomeToDevOpsMay22/goodLuck", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3

then it goes to welcomeToDevOpsMay22/goodLuck

# write(3, "There you go... tell me what I d"..., 36) = 36

and write to the file "There you go... tell me what I do..."
